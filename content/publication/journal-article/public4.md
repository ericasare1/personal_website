abstract: This study investigates the producer/farm characteristics that influence the adoption and extent of adoption of georeferenced grid soil sampling technology, using the two-part model, among cotton producers in the southern U.S. The extent of adoption is the number of acres grid soil sampled. Soil sampling is sometimes seen as the foundation of precision agriculture. The study uses the 2013 survey data on active cotton producers in 14 southern U.S states conducted by Cotton Incorporated. The study identified producersâ€™ awareness of a cost-share reimbursement program, percentage of income from cotton production, the use of yield map, ownership of livestock, land acreage devoted to other crops, and cotton production in Mississippi and Tennessee as important variables that influence the extent of adoption of georeferenced soil sampling technology.
