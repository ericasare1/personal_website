abstract: Pollinator declines and dependence on insect pollination, particularly in fruit and vegetable crops, creates a pressing need to understand growers’ interactions with pollinators and factors affecting pollination strategies. At present, many growers are dependent on commercial honey bees (Apis mellifera), but diversified strategies may be necessary to secure adequate crop pollination in the future. As of yet, little social science research exists on pollination practices. This article presents the results of a survey of lowbush blueberry growers in Maine. The survey was part of a five-year pollination security study focusing on four fruit and vegetables crops in the Northeast US. The survey assesses grower perceptions of native pollinators’ effectiveness and their perceptions of native pollinators’ contribution to fruit set. Results indicate a widespread perception among growers of native pollinators’ importance. While native pollinators are not effective enough to replace rented honey bees for three-quarters of the industry, they are broadly seen as an important form of insurance in poor weather when honey bees’ effectiveness is reduced. The main obstacle to greater utilization of native pollinators found in this study was uncertainty over native pollinators’ contribution to yield and the associated difficulty monitoring native pollinators’ population size. Scientists and extension experts must work to reduce these obstacles before more widespread use of native pollinators will occur.
