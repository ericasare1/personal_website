summary: We compared the efficiency of a uniform policy to a targeted wetland conservation policy. Unlike a targeted policy, a uniform policy assumes that all wetlands are the same. We estimated the model using R statistical package. We found out that a targeted wetland conservation policy is more efficient that a uniform policy.

**CONTEXT**  
We developed an spatially explicit wetland conservation cost model to estimate the private economic benefit of wetland drainage in an agricultural landscape in Alberta, Canada. We use the model to estimate the full wetland supply curve and find that these estimated private economic benefits of wetland drainage are highly hetorogeneous within a the watershed. Our study contributes to our understanding of wetland conservation economics by showing that targeted wetland conservation policies could be a more effective policy at conserving wetlands than a uniform conservation policy that is based on the assumption that all wetlands within an agricultural landscape have the same costs and benefit. 

**DATA SOURCES:**  
We got information on Alberta's relative wetland value and wetland acreage distribution from the 

**METHOD:**  
Our study adds spatially explicit cost information to the methodology of Cortus et al. (2011) to develop watershed-scale estimates of the net-private benefit of wetland drainage . The net private benefit of drainage or wetland conservation cost for this study is defined as the present value of net-returns from producing annual crops on the drained wetland basin (assuming a canola-spring wheat rotation), less the cost of wetland drainage, over 20 years. For our analysis, we used a canola-spring wheat crop rotation as the two crops are the dominant varieties cultivated in this region of Alberta, Canada (Alberta Agriculture and Forestry, 2016); and the canola-spring wheat crop rotation is the most common crop management approach. 

**Results**  
We find a positive correlation between the opportunity costs wetlands impose on private landowners and the amount of environmental benefits wetlands offer. This result suggests that conserving the cheapest wetlands may not be optimal wetland conservation policy. 
**Status of Project**  
We are working on the comments of reviewers to resubmit to the Canadian Jounal of Agricultural Economics.
