summary: There is the need for society to compensate farmers to retain wetlands on their lands. This study provides a web-app that could allow society to estimate the value of wetlands and design an efficient budget to compensate farmers who would want to retain wetlands on their lands.

**CONTEXT**  
Wetlands continue to be degraded around the world, including the Canadian Prairies. In Canada, agricultural development is an important driver of wetland degradation. The services wetlands produce, such as flood control, are public goods in nature, but the presence of wetlands on agricultural lands incur private cost to the farmer. There is the need for society to compensate farmers to retain wetlands on their lands. This study provides a web-app that could allow society to estimate the value of wetlands and design an efficient budget to compensate farmers who would want to retain wetlands on their lands. 

**DATA SOURCES:**  
Our study area Saskatchewan and at the landscape watershed level. We obtained crop budget information from the Saskatchewan Ministry of Agriculture. Also, we used data from published studies that distribution and connectedness of wetlands in the Canadian Prairies. 

**METHOD:**  
We developed a net-present value equation to estimate the opportunity cost of wetlands on agricultural landscape. The opportunity cost of wetland is the forgone benefit to the farmer of retaining the wetland and not converting it toa crop land. Also, we conducted a Monte Carlos simulation to assess the impact of crop prices and crop input prices on the opportunity cost of wetlands. 

**Status of Project**  
We deployed a beta-version one of our web-app to allow our partners to us, especially farmers in Saskatchewan. Based on the feedbacks from users of beta-version 1, we r currently developing beta-version 2. This beta-version too will include a component that allow users to estimate wetland values at the farm level.
