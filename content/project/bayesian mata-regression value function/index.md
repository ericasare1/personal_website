summary: There are substantial differences between Canadians and US wetland values. There are limited information on primary wetland studies in Canada, compared to the US. This project uses a bayesian nonliner model to estimate the willingness of US and Canada households to pay for wetland conservatin. We estimated our model with the "Rstan" package in R. Our results showed that the mean annual willingness to pay for wetland conservation are 510 US dollars, 115 US dollars and 279 US dollars per households in Saskatchewan, Alberta and Manitoba, respectively.

title: Prairie Wetland Loss is Associated with Substantial Economic Costs to Society
---

**CONTEXT**  
Wetlands are depressional areas which contains water for a short period of time (seasonally) or permanently. They provide important ecosystem services (such as flood control, climate change regulation, water quality imporvement, and others) that benefit society. In the Canadian Prairies, about 70% of wetland areas have been lost since European settlement.There remains a disconnect between one-off and region-specific wetland valuation studies by the academic community and the ongoing needs of policy makers to understand trade-offs over time and across the landscape. 

**DATA SOURCES:**  
We compiled a list of studies Canada or USA that estimated the willingness to pay by households for for either wetland area retention or restoration. We obtained the meta data from existing wetland meta-analyses, the Environmental Valuation Reference Inventory (EVRI), and key word searches of environmental and resource economics journals as well as online databases such as EconLit and Google Scholar. 

**METHOD:**  
We developed a generalized framework Canadian wetland valuation model using stated preference studies and nonlinear bayesian meta-regression models. We estimated our model with the "Rstan" and "brms" bayesian packages in R. 

**Results:**  
We demonstrated that that are substantial differences between Canadians and US wetland values, and the use of US only studies would significantly overestimate the value of wetland conservation. We estimated the mean annual willingness to pay for wetland conservation of 510 US dollars, 115 US dollars and 279 US dollars per households in Saskatchewan, Alberta and Manitoba, respectively.

**Status of Project**  
We are about to send to a journal for publication
