* Created a relational dataset on wetlands for multidisciplinary wetland research, using MySQL, allowing members in the group to access reliable wetland-related data for their research.
* Designed, with others, a choice experiment to understand agricultural producers’ wetland conservation practices in the Canadian Prairies. 
* Designed an R Shiny app (version 1) to allow agricultural producers in the Canadian Prairies to value wetlands on their lands using a Net Present Value Simulation method, to inform wetland drainage decisions.
* Identified a cost-effective wetland conservation policy in the Canadian Prairies using a Net Present Value Monte Carlos simulation model. 
* Designed a meta-regression value model, using Bayesian linear and nonlinear mixed models, to estimate values of wetlands in the US and Canada. 
* Predicted land assessment values in Alberta, Canada, using random forest and XGBoost with a prediction accuracy of 70%, which was used as a foundation to classify wetlands into agricultural drainage risks (high, medium, low) for targeted wetland conservation.
