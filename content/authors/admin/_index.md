I am intrigued by data for its enormous potential to provide powerful insights to solve pressing problems. For the past 15 years, I have been applying varied statistical/econometric methods and data visualizations on different forms of data to solve problems. I am passionate about investing in continuous education to prepare me to solve the complexities of data now and its evolution tomorrow. I would love to find the right opportunity to express my skills in a win-win situation.
